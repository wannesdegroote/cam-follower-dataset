# Cam-follower mechanism: dataset description
 This repository contains an extensive dataset generated by a cam-follower setup. The dataset contains a full-factorial design of 1600 experiments. Each experiment contains timeseries captured for a specific cam design, follower mass and motor voltage.

## Lab setup 
The trajectory data is sampled at 2000 Hz by means of a rotary encoder (1000 lines) and a linear encoder (resolution=2µm). The setup is driven by a DC motor of 60 W,  which is fed by a (changeable) constant voltage V. The mass m of the follower can be changed by adding additional disks.

The setup is equipped with 20 interchangeable cams. Each cam is determined by its maximum displacement H and the skewness angle β.

## Data description

We used 20 different cams, 4 different masses and 20 different voltages. This leads to a full-factorial design of 1600 experiments. 
The file parameters.csv describes the parameters used for each experiment.
Experiment number | H |  β | m |V | 
------ | -------------| -------------| -------------| -------------
1 | 0.01 |1/2 π  |0.73 |3.6 |
2 | 0.01 |1/2 π  |0.73| 3.98|
...|... | ...| ...|...| 
1600|0.07 |3/2 π | 1.31|10.8| 

The file expi.csv contains the timeseries collected for the i-th experiment.
Note that some signals are post-processed to eliminate the sensor noise.
Variable |Explanation | 
------|----------|
t | timestamp of the measurement |
θ | angle: directly measured by the rotational encoder |
ω| angular speed: derived from θ via central differencing and some filtering techniques |
α| angular acceleration: derived from ω via central differencing and some filtering techniques  |
y| displacement: directly measured by the linear encoder |
h| cam displacement: directly measured by the linear encoder (=nominal situation without detachment) ||
ϵ| detachment variable: derived via ϵ= y-h and some post-processing to eliminate sensor noise
